I created a simple form consisting 4 columns to store the data of a employee in my database.

Here in js file The function **_validateAndGetFormData()_** is used to get and validate the datas that the users are inputting, using jquery.

Then i useed this function to generate the jsonstr(consisting of the data that needed to be stored) that is needed for json powerdb put request type-post.

After this step two more functions are needed to form the put request json string and make the put request we can manually make those function or can get them in this link http://login2explore.com/jpdb/resources/js/0.0.3/jpdb-commons.js, WE just need to
link this js lib to our page and use those functions when we need them.
